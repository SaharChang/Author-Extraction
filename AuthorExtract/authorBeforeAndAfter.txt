this webquest asks students to explore the life and times of william shakespeare. it is a look into the theatre of the day and the historical significance of the elizabethan era in terms of how we view his work. the importance of creative process is emphasized here as shakespeare is a dramatic medium. students must perform the data they have analyzed in some fashion.

once information is in rdf form, it becomes easy to process it, since rdf is a generic format, which already has many parsers. xml rdf is quite a verbose specification, and it can take some getting used to (for example, to learn xml rdf properly, you need to understand a little about xml and namespaces beforehand...), but let's take a quick look at an example of xml rdf right now:-
 Author: <rdf:rdf xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"      xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"     xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/0.1/foaf/" >     <rdf:description rdf:about="">         <dc:creator rdf:parsetype="resource">             <foaf:name>sean b. palmer</foaf:name>         </dc:creator>         <dc:title>the semantic web: an introduction</dc:title>     </rdf:description> </rdf:rdf> -- Sean Palmer
this piece of rdf basically says that this article has the title "the semantic web: an introduction", and was written by someone whose name is "sean b. palmer". here are the triples that this rdf produces:-

it's been nearly 10 years since tim berners-lee, who is credited with inventing the worldwide web, expressed his vision of a "semantic web," in which all web data -- and the meaning of that data -- could be read by machines. since then, much of the slow-moving progress toward this smarter and more powerful web has been courtesy of academics and data librarians.

i am sure much of the information on the semantic web will be quite useful and accurate because many heavy users of the internet are highly educated in general. however, i am also sure there will be areas of the semantic web not so accurate in its results because the contributors will not be as accurate in their understanding of the material they tagged.

 Author: in the introduction to this series, ken wilber reveals that there are five fundamental components of the integral operating system (ios): quadrants, levels, lines, states and types, and tells us why it is important to have a map of human experience. the map can help us to be sure that we are touching all the bases in our life. the five core elements are not only a part of the ios, they are always available in our moment-to-moment awareness, and to learn them is to be able to better appreciate, exercise and use them in everyday life. -- Ken Wilber
during the last 30 years, we have witnessed a historical first: all of the world’s cultures are now available to us. in the past, if you were born, say, a chinese, you likely spent your entire life in one culture, often in one province, sometimes in one house, living and loving and dying on one small plot of land. but today, not only are people geographically mobile, but we can study, and have studied, virtually every known culture on the planet. in the global village, all cultures are exposed to each other.

fluid dynamics underlies a wide range of physical phenomena in the "real world" on macroscopic scales, with applications for example in engineering, biology, the environmental sciences, geophysics and astrophysics. this course will introduce the study of the macroscopic physics of fluid flows. the topics covered will illustrate a variety of aspects of modern fluid dynamics.

introduction to quantum physics
 Author: written by david stern -- David Stern
this series of eight linked web pages provides a non-mathematical introduction to atomic theory from a historical perspective. the foundations of quantum physics are traced from the discovery of atoms up to quantum tunneling. other topics include atomic spectra and blackbody radiation. this is part of "from stargazers to starships", an extensive web site covering introductory topics in physics and astronomy. spanish and french translations are available.

quantum error correction
 Author: . although the phrase `error correction' is a natural one and was used with reference to quantum computers prior to 1996, it was only in that year that two important papers, of calderbank and shor, and independently steane, established a general framework whereby quantum information processing can be used to combat a very wide class of noise processes in a properly designed quantum system. much progress has since been made in generalising these ideas (knill and laflamme 1997, ekert and macchiavello 1996, bennett -- Steane
